# Exploring the TED Talks Kaggle [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/ted-talks)

More info for the dataset can be gathered from the introductiory parts of the dataset author's [analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/ted-data-analysis).

Our purpose is to try and see what data could be useful for estimating `views` and/or `comments`.

All experiments were run on the default `base` environment of a fresh installion of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section) 2019.07 for Linux.

The Jupyter notebook can be run via `jupyter notebook` from the console (opens up a browser) and selecting `TED Talks Kaggle.ipynb`.
For convenience of the reader, a static version is exported in the form of an HTML file - `TED Talks Kaggle.html` - can be opened with any modern browser.
